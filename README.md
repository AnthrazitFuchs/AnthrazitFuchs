- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnthrazitFuchs but friends call me Chris.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, like coding, languages and the like.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics on free Code Camp but trying my best.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for the foreseeable future. I wouldn't want to bother anyone with my inexperience.
- But I am open for learning suggestions... :D 
- 📫 You can reach me here :D When I'm more comfortable with everything I may set up another way ;D
